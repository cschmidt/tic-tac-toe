Game Play 1.0
-------------
- allow forfeit/reset/"start new game"?
- invite a friend to play (can be as simple as sending a URL)
- visual indication of the outcome ("X wins!", for example)
- visual indication of where you can and cannot mark a square (i.e. square
  is already marked)
- square keys shouldn't be case sensitive

DONE
- figure out draws


Game Play 2.0
-------------
- keep game history


Infrastructure
--------------
- simulate asynchronous moves (add a delay?) in preparation for sharing game
  state
